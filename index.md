# Lab Report 2
I used the same methods from class that were used during the labs (add numbers URL one) and changed one of the methods to add strings together using StringBuilder and append. It will try to locate the term "/add-message" in the URL, if it doesn't find any strings after it will just return the "404 Not Found!" as an error message. If the /add-message is found in the URL with the strings following it will update "Stringer" by appending the words. Lastly, it will return Stringer as a response and appear on the page.

Next, I tested by using the example that was given to me in the lab report which was "/add-message?s=Hello" in which it printed the statement "Hello" correctly
