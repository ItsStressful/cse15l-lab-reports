## Step 3: Git Cloning
**Then I typed `Git clone` and followed with the paste command `/+v/` (the SSH link for lab 7 was saved in my clipboard) making a clone:**

## Step 7: Working in Command Mode
**While I was in Vim I checked to see what I needed to fix by scrolling using `<j>` in order to go down. After I located the need to change the code line that read** > index1 += 1; **I proceeded to change it by hovering over the "1" (in "index1") then pressed `<x>` to delete the one then pressed `<i>` in order to enter insert mode where I would replace it will the correct number `<2>`. Finally, I made sure I exited insert mode by pressing `<esc>` followed by exiting and saving by typing `:wq` or rather `<:> <w> <q>`**

## Step 8: Running the Newly Edited Code
**Lastly I pressed `<up> <up> <enter>` in order to locate the `Bash test.sh` that I used before and ran the tests again, in which they gave no test failures this time**
